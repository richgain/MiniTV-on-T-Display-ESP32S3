I’ve watched lots of videos by various people including  @moononournation  ,  @taylor.galbraith  ,  @atomic14  and others, demonstrating how to play short videos on an ESP32 board with an attached screen. I haven’t yet seen anyone demonstrate this on the TTGO T-Display ESP32S3 though, so I have been doing it the hard way, by collecting and configuring snippets of code for my SD card, sound card, and display device. I have finally managed to get it to the point where the video and audio files are read from the SD card, the audio plays nicely, and the screen springs into life! Unfortunately, the screen image is all jumbled up and I have no idea why. 
Any help at this point would be gratefully received.
